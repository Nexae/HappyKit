Getting started with Happy Kit

Happy Kit is an awesome program. Every 5 minutes, it sends a popup notification. 

A great part about Happy Kit is that it is cross platform. Currently, there is official support for Windows and Linux, but I don't see why it wouldn't work on Mac OSX!

The setup is really easy no matter what platform you are on.

Linux: 
1. Download happy kit 
2. Extract the zip. This should create a folder.
3. Delete the zip, but keep the folder.
4. Move the folder to your home, and rename the folder to happykit .
5. Open the folder
6. On Ubuntu, double click 'linux' and you're done!
7. On other OSes, you need to run these commands in terminal, and then you're done:

cd happykit
./linux


Note: you may need to run sudo apt-get install notify-send in the terminal.

Mac:
Please note that there is no official support for Mac. These instructions may not work.

1. Download happy kit 
2. Open Finder
3. Move happy kit to your Downloads folder (it should be in there by default)
4. Rename the folder to happykit .
5. Open terminal
6. Type these commands:

cd  ~/Downloads
cd happykit
sudo apt-get install notify-send
python linux.py


Please note that there will be official support for Mac by September 1, 2014.

Windows:

- Download happy kit 
- IMPORTANT: Move it to your DESKTOP
- Extract it and rename the folder to "happykit"
- Open the happykit folder and then the windows folder
- Double-click "windows.exe"
- Enjoy Happy Kit!

Note: I did not create Notifu. I am using it.
