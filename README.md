HappyKit
========
Happy Kit is a really cool program for so many reasons. 

***I DID NOT CREATE NOTIFU. I AM USING IT.***

Every 5 minutes, it sends a popup notification like so:

The best part is that it is cross platform.

It works on Windows, Mac and Linux! It also uses native programs to do it. No having to do weird stuff.

On Linux and Windows, you shouldn't have to install ANYTHING!
<br />
(Well, except for Happy Kit, that is)

So, onto the setup.

<h2>LINUX:</h2>
- Download the .zip <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/HappyKit/archive/master.zip">here</a>
- Move it to your home directory.
- Extract it and rename it to "happykit" 
- Delete the .zip, but keep the folder (they are two seperate files)
- Open terminal
- run:
```
cd happykit
python linux.py
```
- The first time it runs, it will download something
- Done! 


<h2>MAC: </h2>
Hang on. Working on it.


<h2>WINDOWS: </h2>
Ok. So its super easy to use Happy Kit. First...

- Download the .zip <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/HappyKit/archive/master.zip">here</a>
- Move it to your Desktop, or really anywhere you would like
- Extract it and rename the folder to "happykit"
