Quoti is an awesome program. Every 5 minutes, it sends a really awesome popup notification. Here are some screenshots.

As you can see, a great part about Quoti is that it is cross platform. Currently, there is official support for Windows and Linux. It should work on Mac, though!

The setup is really easy no matter what platform you are on. Just run *Quoti.py* in your Python interpreter. Please ensure you have python-gobject installed, as this uses PyGObject.
