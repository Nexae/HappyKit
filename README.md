HappyKit
========
Happy Kit is a really cool program for so many reasons. 

***I DID NOT CREATE NOTIFU. I AM USING IT.***

Every 5 minutes, it sends a popup notification like so:

The best part is that it is cross platform.

It works on Windows, Mac and Linux! It also uses native programs to do it. No having to do weird stuff.

On Linux and Windows, you shouldn't have to install ANYTHING!
<br />
(Well, except for Happy Kit, that is)

<h1>Top 4 reasons you should try happy kit:</h1>

<b>1. It works on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows</b>

For most computers, it should work right after you download it.

<b>2. It works out of the box</b>

Yep, all you need to do is download it and run it.

Happy kit simply works great! It's there when you need it and out of your way when you don't need it.
