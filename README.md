HappyKit
========
Happy Kit is a really cool program for so many reasons. 

Every 5 minutes, it sends a popup notification like so:

The best part is that it is cross platform.

It works on Windows, Mac and Linux! It also uses native programs to do it. No having to do weird stuff.

On Linux, you shouldn't have to install ANYTHING! 

So, onto the setup.

<h2>LINUX:</h2>
- Download the .zip <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/HappyKit/archive/master.zip">here</a>
- Download it in your home directory.
- Extract it and rename it to "happykit" 
- Open terminal
- run:
```
cd happykit
python linux.py
```
- The first time it runs, it will download something
- Done! 


<h2>MAC: </h2>
Hang on. Working on it.


<h2>WINDOWS: </h2>
Almost done.
