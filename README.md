HappyKit
========
Happy Kit is a really cool program for so many reasons. 

***I DID NOT CREATE NOTIFU. I AM USING IT.***

Every 5 minutes, it sends a popup notification like so:

<b>Linux<b> (<a href="http://www.elementaryos.org">Elementary OS</a>)
<br />

<b>Windows</b> (Windows 8)
<br />

The best part is that it is cross platform.

It works on Windows and Linux(Mac support coming soon)! It also uses native programs to do it. No having to do weird stuff.

On Linux and Windows, you shouldn't have to install ANYTHING!
<br />
(Well, except for Happy Kit, that is)

So, onto the setup.

<h2>LINUX:</h2>
<b>Note:</b> You may need to run this command: sudo apt-get install notify-send

- Download the .zip <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/HappyKit/archive/master.zip">here</a>
- Move it to your HOME directory.
- Extract it and rename it to "happykit" 
- Delete the .zip, but keep the folder (they are two seperate files)
- Open terminal
- run <code>cd happykit && ./linux</code>
- Done! 

Optional: Move the linux file to your home directory (/home/YOURUSERNAME/linux) so you can just open the terminal and type ./linux


<h2>MAC: </h2>
The setup is similar to Linux, but a little different.

- Download the ZIP <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/HappyKit/archive/master.zip">here</a>
- Rename it to "happykit" 
- Open terminal
- run:
```
cd ~/Downloads
mv ~/Downloads/happykit happykit
cd
cd happykit
python linux.py
```
- The first time it runs, it will download something
- Done! 


<h2>WINDOWS: </h2>
Ok. So it's <b>REALLY</b> easy to use Happy Kit. First...

- Download the .zip <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/HappyKit/archive/master.zip">here</a>
- <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Move it to your DESKTOP
- Extract it and rename the folder to "happykit"
- You can delete the zip now, if you want. Just be sure to keep the folder.
- Open the happykit folder and the windows folder
- Double-click "Windows.exe"
- Enjoy Happy Kit!

If you are an awesome person looking for a test case, look in the windows folder in happykit. It will be pretty obvious when you've found it.
