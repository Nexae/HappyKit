As you can see, a great part about Happy Kit is that it is cross platform. Currently, there is officiall support for Windows and Linux, but I don't see why it wouldn't work on Mac OSX!

The setup is really easy no matter what platform you are on.

1. Download happy kit <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/HappyKit/archive/master.zip">here</a>!

<h2>WINDOWS: </h2>
Ok. So it's <b>REALLY</b> easy to use Happy Kit. First...

- <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Move it to your DESKTOP

- You can delete the zip now, if you want. Just be sure to keep the folder.
- Open the happykit folder and the windows folder
- Double-click "Windows.exe"
- Enjoy Happy Kit!

If you are an awesome person looking for a test case, look in the windows folder in happykit. It will be pretty obvious when you've found it.
Lastly, I did not create Notifu. I am using it.
