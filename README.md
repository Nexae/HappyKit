<h2>Quoti</h2>

Quoti is an awesome program. Every 5 minutes, it sends a really awesome popup notification. Here are some screenshots.

As you can see, a great part about Quoti is that it is cross platform. Currently, there is official support for Windows and Linux, but I don't see why it wouldn't work on Mac OSX!

Another great thing is that the entire .zip is only 3.3 mb in size!

The setup is really easy no matter what platform you are on.

<h3>Linux: </h3>
1. Download Quoti <a href="https://github.com/Nexae/quot/archive/master.zip">here</a>!
2. Extract the zip. This should create a folder.
3. Delete the zip, but keep the folder.
4. Move the folder to your home, and rename the folder to happykit .
5. Open the folder
6. On Ubuntu, double click 'linux' and you're done!
7. On other OSes, you need to run these commands in terminal, and then you're done:
```
cd happykit
./linux
```

Note: you may need to run <code>sudo apt-get install notify-osd</code> in the terminal.

<h3>Mac: </h3>
Please note that there is no official support for Mac. These instructions may not work.
