HappyKit
========
Happy Kit is a really cool program for so many reasons. 

***I DID NOT CREATE NOTIFU. I AM USING IT.***

Every 5 minutes, it sends a popup notification like so:

The best part is that it is cross platform.

It works on Windows, Mac and Linux! It also uses native programs to do it. No having to do weird stuff.

On Linux and Windows, you shouldn't have to install ANYTHING!
<br />
(Well, except for Happy Kit, that is)

<h1>Top 4 reasons you should try happy kit:</h1>

For most computers, it should work right after you download it.
